SVG Paths

Definition : 
  SVG Paths represent the outline of a shape that can be stroked, filled, used as a clipping path,
  or any combination of all three.
  Which means that you can use an SVG Path to make any type of SVG shape.

Example:
  <svg width="100" height="100">
    <path d=" M 10 25
              L 10 75
              L 60 75
              L 10 25"
              stroke="red" stroke-width="2" fill="none" />
  </svg>

  Notes:
  - d attribute --> contains a series of commands and parameters in the SVG Path Mini-Language. 
    These commands and parameters are a sequential set of instructions for how to "move the pen over the paper".
