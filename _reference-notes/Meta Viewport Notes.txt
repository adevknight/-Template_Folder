> width=device-width 
  // Originally Apple-Proprietary, but then adopted on other mobile browsers 
  // Case Study iPhone 5 (Retina Display) : 
     Without 'width=device-width' the browser viewport width will have 980 of 'CSS Pixel' (980px) and
     the device-width = 320px (CSS Pixel too).
     If we apply 'width=device-width' the browser viewport width will have 320px (CSS Pixel) and 
     the device-width still same (never change) 320px.
  // The visual difference would be :
     Without 'width=device-width' text look too far (zoom out effect).
     With 'width=device-width' text fit on screen proportion (not in zoom out nor zoom in mode).

> initial-scale=1
  // Currently we 2 unit of pixel measurement during web/app development
     Device Pixel, and
     CSS Pixel (in Android called Device Independent Pixel or Density Independent Pixel or dp or dip), 
     The relationship between Device Pixel and CSS Pixel is defined in 'device-pixel-ratio' or 'resolution' feature in media 
     IF we do not set 'initial-scale=1' when we write in CSS :
        font-size: 12px actually it does not represent 12px of 'CSS Pixel' or 'dip' value
        margin: 22px actually it does not represent 22px of 'CSS Pixel' or 'dip' value
        padding: 32px actually it does not represent 32px of 'CSS Pixel' or 'dip' value
     However, if we set meta viewport 'initial-scale=1' when we write in CSS :
        font-size: 12px match exacly as 12px of 'CSS Pixel' or 'dip' value
        margin: 22px match exacly as 22px of 'CSS Pixel' or 'dip' value
        padding: 32px match exacly as 32px of 'CSS Pixel' or 'dip' value
  // Adding the attribute 'initial-scale=1' instructs browsers to establish a 1:1 relationship between 
     'Writed CSS Pixels' and CSS Pixel or device independent pixels (dip) regardless of device orientation, 
     and allows the page to take advantage of the full landscape width.
