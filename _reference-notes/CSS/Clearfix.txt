  - Prolog
  Before using "float" element in your website, let us consider few things :
    -- If your target is > IE9 then better use
        display: inline-block; or
        display: flex; (More Advanced, Less Support, for future)
    -- Use "float" property only if we need support for <= IE9

  - Definition
  By nature a <div> or a block element that contain one or many floated child elements will ignore their presense,
  in essense, they were just ignoring them and do not properly contain them as it suppose to be.
  Examples:
    <div class="container">
      <div class="float-left">LEFT</div>
      <div class="float-right">RIGHT</div>
    </div>

    IF we don't specify the .container height (Most of the time we won't specify the height),
    then the .container will have no height at all, eventhough the .float-left and .float-right clearly have some height.
    This is what we called anomaly of float container.
  
  In order to give the auto height to the .container so it can really contain the .float-left and .float-right we must apply
  either a BFC with overflow: hidden | auto; or A CLEARFIX CLASS to the .container.
