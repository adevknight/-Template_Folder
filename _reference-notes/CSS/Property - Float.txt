> Float
  If a <div> set it to float:left or float:right, then 
  
  ... The <div> BLOCK behaviour will gone. 
      It start to behave like INLINE-BLOCK element (not INLINE element).
  
  ... It 
        will NOT float on top of "previous (base on HTML structure) BLOCK element",
        will NOT float on top of "previous (base on HTML structure) INLINE-BLOCK element".
        will float on top of the "last line of previous (base on HTML structure) INLINE element".

      but it will let
        "next (base on HTML structure) BLOCK element" and
        "next (base on HTML structure) INLINE or INLINE-BLOCK element" 
        to flow/wrap around on its left side if we set the <div> to float:right, or
        to flow/wrap around on its right side if we set the <div> to float:left,
        without reducing their width (The <div> just like floating on top of them).
> Clear
  IF
    <div class="float-right">FLOAT RIGHT</div>
    <div class="text">Lorem...</div>
  THEN
    The .text element will wrap around the left side of .float-right, if we do not want this "wrapping" to happen
    then we add clear:right to .text element so it will move down and not sit beside the .float-right element.

  IN ESSENCE 
    clear: right = I don't want any "floated" element sit on my right side.
    clear: left = I don't want any "floated" element sit on my left side.
    clear: both = I don't want any "floated" element sit on my right and left side.
