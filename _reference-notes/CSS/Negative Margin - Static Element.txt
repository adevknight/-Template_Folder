> Negative Margin - Static Element
  Static Element = Element with NO FLOAT applied to it.

  - IF A Negative Margin Applied in Static Element (.negatived in following example), then
    ## CASE A - display:block
    <div class="container">
      <div class="negatived">Negative Margin</div>
      <div class="succeding">Succeding Element</div>
    </div>
    with
      .container {
        display: block;
        height: 120px;
      }
      .negatived {
        display: block;
        height: 50px;
      }
      .succeding {
        display: block;
        height: 50px;
      }
    -- IF .negatived {margin-top = -30px}
       It will make .negatived to MOVE UPWARDS by 30px
       ALSO it will make .succeding to MOVE UPWARDS by 30px
       ALSO it will make .container to MOVE UPWARDS by 30px
       NOTE: - Will not make vertical scrollbar to appear.
             - If we set margin-left: 50px and margin-top: 50px to .container
               We will see the new position of .negatived, .succeding and .container.
             - IF .container {display: inline-block} 
               THEN the .container width will be THE LONGEST WIDTH BETWEEN .negatived and .succeding (Even when they set the width property).
               AND the .container NEVER MOVE UPWARDS AGAIN AND IT WILL MAINTAIN THE WIDTH, HEIGHT, AND POSITION.

    -- IF .negatived {margin-left = -30px}
       IF no "width" is applied to .negatived and .succeding.
        It will JUST make .negatived to EXTEND THE WIDTH by 30px to the LEFT
        NOTE: - Will not make horizontal scrollbar to appear.
              - If we set margin-left: 50px and margin-top: 50px to .container
                We will see the extended width of .negatived surpass the .container.
              - IF .container {display: inline-block} 
               THEN the .container width will be THE LONGEST WIDTH BETWEEN .negatived and .succeding (BEFORE the EXTENDED .negatived width appear).
               AND the .container NEVER MOVE TO THE LEFT AND IT WILL MAINTAIN THE WIDTH, HEIGHT, AND POSITION.
       IF "width: 150px or width:100%" is applied to .negatived and .succeding.
        It will JUST make .negatived to MOVE by 30px to the LEFT.
        NOTE: - Will not make horizontal scrollbar to appear.
              - If we set margin-left: 50px and margin-top: 50px to .container
                We will see the new position of .negatived surpass the .container.
              - IF .container {display: inline-block} 
               THEN the .container width will be 150px or THE LONGEST WIDTH BETWEEN .negatived and .succeding.
               AND the .container NEVER MOVE TO THE LEFT AND IT WILL MAINTAIN THE WIDTH, HEIGHT, AND POSITION.

    -- IF .negatived {margin-bottom = -30px}
       It will JUST make .succeding to MOVE UPWARDS overlap the .negatived (like absolute positioned element) by 30px
       NOTE: - Will not make vertical scrollbar to appear.
             - If we set margin-left: 50px and margin-top: 50px to .container
               We will see the new position of .succeding.
             - IF .container {display: inline-block} 
               THEN the .container width will be THE LONGEST WIDTH BETWEEN .negatived and .succeding (Even when they set the width property).
               AND the .container NEVER MOVE AND IT WILL MAINTAIN THE WIDTH, HEIGHT, AND POSITION.

    -- IF .negatived {margin-right = -30px}
       IF no "width" is applied to .negatived and .succeding.
        It will JUST make .negatived to EXTEND THE WIDTH by 30px to the RIGHT
        NOTE: - Will make horizontal scrollbar to appear.
              - We will see right away the extended width of .negatived surpass the .container.
              - IF .container {display: inline-block} 
                THEN the .container width will be THE LONGEST WIDTH BETWEEN .negatived and .succeding (BEFORE the EXTENDED .negatived width appear).
                AND the .container NEVER MOVE AND IT WILL MAINTAIN THE WIDTH, HEIGHT, AND POSITION.
       IF "width: 150px or width:100%" is applied to .negatived and .succeding.
        NOTHING WILL HAPPEN.
        NOTE: - IF .container {display: inline-block}
                THEN NOTHING WILL HAPPEN 
                AND the .container width will be THE LONGEST WIDTH BETWEEN .negatived and .succeding.
                AND the .container NEVER MOVE AND IT WILL MAINTAIN THE WIDTH, HEIGHT, AND POSITION.

       It will make .negatived to MOVE by 30px to the LEFT.
       ALSO It will make .succeding to MOVE by 30px to the LEFT.
       NOTE: - Will not make horizontal scrollbar to appear.
             - If we set margin-left: 50px and margin-top: 50px to .container
               We will see the new position of .negatived and .succeding surpass the .container.
             - IF .container {display: inline-block} THEN ITS WIDTH WILL SHRUNK by 30px.
